          I love music and I think you do too. Music is a powerful tool. 
          It moves people and captures a point like no other medium. 
          I strive to teach in the most fun and engaging way possible. Every
          Student is unqique. Playing music is a life long journey of mastery.
          The ultimate goal is to express yourself freely on the instrument and play anything you 
          hear, whether it's an idea in your head or a song you like. 
          I want you to take your skills out into the community and play music for yourself,
          friends and family. Play around the campfire, at a coffee shop or on
          the big stage.
          I want your love of music to grow and I will provide you with a wealth of 
          technical, stylistic and theoretical knowledge that’s second to none.

          I started playing when I was 12. I took lessons from a local music 
          shop for several years and eventually started working there when I was 16.
          I met local musicians and just began
          playing in bands creating grunge and metal music. It was a blast. 
          After college I started playing in a hip hop fusion band we played a 
          lot of shows and received a local music award. Today you can find me playing
          guitar in a Christian worship band.

          My goal is to teach as many people to play guitar. I think the world
          would be a better place with more muscians and more music.
          I will never stop learning. I will constantly be developing
          new ways of teaching and studying.

          I believe simplicity is the result of profound reflection; that results
          matter; and that demonstrating those skills in a live setting is the best way to validate our learning.
